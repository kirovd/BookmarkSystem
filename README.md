## BookmarkSystem

This is a bookmark system that was created for people to have full control of their bookmarks with add/edit/delete function. 
This bookmark system stores the data locally in the local storage. I did this so that people can actually access the bookmarks even if the page is closed.

## Validation

I used Google Advanced Compilation to validate the page when entry. I have used validation when the user submits the form when empty. The validation that contains a message thanking the user for a submission wasn’t done.

## Add/Visit/Edit/Delete/Save/Cancel

The add button is actually when the user fills in the form and presses submit. The visit button was created so that people can view the website as text in a different tab. The visit was created in a way so that the user can see only the Website name. 
The edit button gets the URL of the bookmark and places it on the URL text input so that the user can edit the URL. As for the Website name I had some issues it actually states as "undefined". Therefore, I used the same get method, didn't work and I left it as it is. When the save button is pressed it saves the edited bookmark as a different directory, meaning it does not override the original one. 
The cancel button clears the form if field whether it’s when editing or adding. The delete button was created so that the user can delete the added bookmark from the page itself and the local storage within the browser.

## Pagination

#### The pagination should include numbered pagination with next and previous links eg. < 1 2 3 >.
It shows the pagination within the wesbite application but with no function. 


## Technologies Used

I used HTML/CSS/Bootstrap and pure JavaScript.
